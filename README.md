Proof-of-concept for private data transmission on the NEAR blockchain.

## Demo

The `client/` project simply executes a sequence of operations that demonstrate the essential functionality of the protocol. It will generate and upload a key to a key repository for two different accounts, and then send messages between the two accounts. In order for it to work properly, create a `.env` file at the workspace root with the following contents:

```ini
KEY_FILE_PATH="<path>"
KEY2_FILE_PATH="<path>"
NETWORK="testnet"
KEY_REGISTRY_ACCOUNT_ID="<account-id>"
MESSAGE_REPOSITORY_ACCOUNT_ID="<account-id>"
```

Where `KEY_FILE_PATH` & `KEY2_FILE_PATH` are locations of NEAR key files (same format generated by `near-cli`). Usually these are located at `<USER_HOME>/.near-credentials/<network>/<account>.json`.

A test key registry is `dev-1677133604850-79852956982344`, and a test message repository is `dev-1677495962544-63904069110992`.

Then you can run `cargo run` from the `client/` directory and it should perform the sequence.

Currently there is not much of a user-friendly interface, and it is not interactive. Those features are _Coming Soon_&trade;.
