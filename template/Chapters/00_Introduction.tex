The goal of this paper is to build upon the work of previous protocols to hide even more metadata about conversations. In particular, we will hide the following information, in addition to hiding of the payload itself:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sender's identity.
\item
  Sender's location (geographical and network).
\item
  Timestamp of transmission.
\item
  Receiver's identity.
\item
  Receiver's location (geographical and network).
\item
  Timestamp of receipt.
\item
  Payload size.
\item
  Conversation history.
\end{itemize}

However, privacy of these data is not sufficient to make a usable protocol. Therefore, we will also aim to fulfill the following properties that make the protocol usable:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Users can easily use the service across multiple devices, including message synchronization.
\item
  Group messaging is efficient and scalable.
\item
  The service is inexpensive to run as a server and as a user/client.
\end{itemize}
