The proof-of-concept is a simple command-line application that allows for $1 \leftrightarrow 1$ messaging between two parties. The proof of concept is written in Rust, and uses the \href{https://github.com/dalek-cryptography}{\emph{Dalek} libraries} for cryptographic primitives, as well as \href{https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/tree/master/chacha20poly1305}{\emph{ChaCha20-Poly1305}} for encryption.

Even without enabling many of the privacy-enhancing features, the simple application struggles to approach real-time communications, with regular
latencies of 1-3 seconds.
